# GitHub Copilot Prompt:
# This app is a Streamlit-based data analytics dashboard called Smart Insights.
# Ensure the following logic is preserved across all pages:
# 1. Only the Home page allows users to upload, add, or remove datasets.
# 2. Once a dataset is uploaded, it is stored in st.session_state["uploaded_data"] and must be persistently accessible across all pages.
# 3. All other pages (Dashboard, Forecasting, ML Insights, Export, Settings) must use this session data without asking the user to upload again.
# 4. If "uploaded_data" is not found in the session state, pages should show a friendly warning and stop.
# 5. Currency and country selections (for conversion or API use) are stored in st.session_state["currency"] and st.session_state["country"], and should be respected globally.
# 6. IP location data is retrieved once and stored in st.session_state["ipinfo"] for sidebar display and optional logic.
# 7. Do not use st.set_page_config() anywhere except the root app.py file.
# 8. All data manipulation must be robust: handle nulls, invalid formats, and incorrect column selections with clear error messages.
# 9. Forecasting and ML models must not break if the dataset is small, empty, or mismatched ‚Äî always validate input first.
# 10. Export page must allow exporting the current session dataset and computed outputs.
# 11. All API integrations (currency, holidays, IPInfo) must be non-blocking, handle errors gracefully, and cache where possible.
# 12. Sidebar must remain consistent across all pages ‚Äî include branding, user location, and a working navigation menu.
# 13. Optimize for clarity, user experience, and no repeated uploads or broken logic. Each page should load and function independently but share session state.
